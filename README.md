# Object Detection with Camera 📷

A Flutter-based application that utilizes machine learning models to detect and classify objects in real-time through a device's camera. The app integrates TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) or ML Kit to enable live object detection on both Android and iOS platforms.

## ✨ Features

- Real-time object detection using the device's camera
- Integration with **TensorFlow Lite** or **ML Kit**
- Cross-platform support (Android & iOS)
- Smooth and optimized performance
- User-friendly UI with camera overlay for detected objects

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Flutter SDK: [Installation Guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
- Dart
- Android Studio or VS Code (with Flutter and Dart plugins)
- Git
- TensorFlow Lite / ML Kit setup

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/engAhmedSami/object_detection_with_camera.git
   cd object_detection_with_camera
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. Configure Dependencies:
   - Ensure **TFLite** or **ML Kit** models are available in the assets directory.
   - Add the required permissions for camera access in `AndroidManifest.xml` and `Info.plist` for iOS.

4. Run the app:
   ```sh
   flutter run
   ```

## 📌 Notes & Limitations

- Ensure that **TensorFlow Lite** or **ML Kit** is properly configured.
- **Performance may vary** depending on the device’s hardware.
- The app currently supports **portrait mode only**.
- **Internet access may be required** for some ML model updates.
